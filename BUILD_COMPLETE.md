## üì¶ Deployed Files

**Main JAR:** `/var/lib/pterodactyl/volumes/31a2482a-dbb7-4d21-8126-bde346cb17db/plugins/stormcraft-events-0.1.0.jar` (76K)

**Dependencies:**
- `stormcraft-2.0.0.jar` (compiled into JAR)
- `stormcraft-essence-0.1.0.jar` (compiled into JAR)
- Paper 1.21.3
- Java 21

## üéÆ How to Use

1. **Start Server** - Plugin will auto-load and detect Stormcraft
2. **Wait for Storms** - Events spawn automatically based on player density near storms
3. **Check Events** - Use `/stormevent list` to see active events
4. **Configure** - Edit `plugins/Stormcraft-Events/config.yml` and reload

## üîß Configuration Highlights

### Event Spawn Weights
- Storm Surge: 30 (most common)
- Storm Rift: 20
- Tempest Guardian: 15
- Town Siege: 10
- Storm Titan: 5 (rarest)

### Spawn Zones
- **Storm Core** (0-50 blocks): 60% spawn chance
- **Storm Periphery** (50-150 blocks): 30% spawn chance
- **Storm Influence** (150-300 blocks): 10% spawn chance

### Density-Based Spawning
- Base spawn chance: 5%
- Player multiplier: 0.1 (logarithmic scaling)
- Max spawn chance: 50%
- Check interval: 30 seconds

## üìù Notes

### MythicMobs Integration
- Uses reflection for compatibility
- Fallback to vanilla mobs if MythicMobs unavailable
- Configure mob types in `config.yml`:
  - `TempestGuardian` for mini-boss
  - `StormTitan` for world boss

### Town Siege System
- Requires Towny OR TownsAndNations
- Mobs spawn around town perimeter (30-80 blocks)
- Can break configured blocks (doors, chests, etc.)
- Towns can opt-out via permission
- 1 hour cooldown per town

### Boss Damage Tracking
- Damage-based reward distribution
- Must deal 5% damage minimum to get rewards
- Top 3 contributors announced
- Essence split based on damage share

## üêõ Known Limitations

1. Events require active storms to spawn
2. MythicMobs integration uses reflection (may break with MM updates)
3. TownsAndNations integration is simplified (basic support only)
4. Boss bars may conflict if too many concurrent events (limit: 2-3)

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Restart server** to load the plugin
2. **Test each event type** with different player counts
3. **Configure MythicMobs** boss definitions if desired
4. **Adjust spawn rates** in config based on server population
5. **Set up town permissions** if using Towny/TAN
